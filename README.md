# Challenge 02

## Description

In this assignment we are to create our own portfolio page. Using the HTML and CSS learned in the first two weeks. 
No projects have been completed yet so the links in the portfolio just lead back to the git home page. Placeholders have been put into place which will eventually replaced by an image that describes the project and contents that I would showcase.
